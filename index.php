        <h2>It's Our Planet, Let's Fix It</h2>
        <hr />
        <h2>Climate Change Effects</h2>
            <p> Climate change is affecting the world around us in the here and now. One major downside of 
                climate change is how it destabilizes our weather patterns. Just last month we saw the first
                major hurricane in the US since 2005, Harvey. This storm ripped through Texas and Louisiana and
                caused mass flooding. Even Vermont saw hurricane Irene in 2011 and the east coast states had hurricane 
                Sandy in 2012. These storms will continue to happen as climate change worsens. At my home state, New Jersey,
                I have been seeing the water levels of Barnegat bay at the Jersey Shore getting higher and higher each year. 
                This is due to the rising oceans brought on by melting polar ice caps and rising sea temperatures. Our coastal
                towns and cities will remain at risk to rising sea levels. </p>
            <p> Climate change also brings direct impact to the life on earth. Obviously, the melting ice caps damages the lives
                of animals that live on Earth's most extreme biome. Polar bears, penguins, and other polar animals are seeing
                their territory shrink everyday. Unfortunately, current life loss is much more widespread. According to 
                iflscience.com, the current extinction rate is "10 times worse than previously thought". After analyzing extinction
                rates in fossil records, scientists have come to the conclusion that the rate is higher than it has been in the past 
                without human interference. This means that human-caused climate change and deforestation is killing off Earth's 
                wildlife, a true tragedy.</p>
        <h2>What We Can Do About It</h2>
            <p>Some try to deny the human-caused climate changes that are occurring on our planet.
               This does not prevent the evidence gathered by the scientific community to hold any less
               weight though. In fact, 97% of scientists support the notion of human-caused climate change. The sad truth is 
               that on a global scale, the actions we take as individuals
               seems negligible. To the surprise of many, only 10% of water is used for domestic use. The agriculture sector uses
               70%, and industry uses the remaining 20% according to "worldometers.info". At the same time, according
               to the EPA, only 14% of greenhouse gas emissions come from transportation, while 21% come from industry,
               25% from energy production, and 25% from agriculture. What this says to me is that we need to focus less 
               on individual habits. Taking shorter showers, buying an electric car, and recycling are simply not going to slow climate change.
               What really needs to be done is larger changes to our infrastructure and industry. We need to get our
               energy from clean and renewable sources, this is the most paramount change. Solar, geothermal, wind, river, and nuclear
               prove to be the most promising options. This will reduce gas emissions
               from the three big sectors: industry, agriculture, and energy.
               Here in Burlington, a majority of our electricity is produced by burning bio-waste like tree bark and grass. This is an improvement from burning coal,
               but it still produces greenhouse gas. Vermonters who think they are doing the Earth a great service by driving an electric car 
               are actually still contributing to greenhouse gas emissions by enlarging the demand for electricity. We also need ways to improve lab grown meat
               or severely cut back on cattle raising, for they produce methane which is a much more effective greenhouse 
               gas than CO<sub>2</sub>. As the world's population grows, so does the importance of massive efficency improvements to agriculture which is hugely responsible 
               for deforestation, water usage, and greenhouse gas emissions. Changing these important sectors is the best chance we have of slowing climate change.</p>
