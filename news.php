            <p>"Surveillance is the business model of the internet."</p>

            <p>This article is an interview conducted by the Harvard Gazette with Bruce Schneier, a fellow of the Berkman Klein Center for Internet and Society. He discusses government
                and corporate surveillance with the Gazette, which first asked him about the changes in mass surveillance since Edward Snowden’s leaks. According to Schneier, “people should 
                be alarmed,” because there hasn’t been much change in US government surveillance since 2013. He attributes this in part to the lack of current news coverage about cybersecurity 
                and privacy, even pointing out, “it was not an issue in the 2016 election.” </p>
            
            <p>He then goes on to talk about corporate surveillance, saying it is the, “business model of the internet.” The data that corporations collect are used in marketing products to 
                consumers. The business model Schneier is referring to, is websites sell the data they collect on their users to advertisers, which get money from companies who want to advertize
                themselves.</p>

            <p>Battle of the Clipper Chip</p>
            
            <p>The clipper chip was a physical backdoor for encrypted communications proposed by the US federal government. The chip allows for a second key pair to decrypt a message sent
               through peer-to-peer encryption. The US government wants this sort of access to communications for surveillance. If all phones had a clipper chip installed, the federal 
               government could listen in while keeping the communication private from the general public. This was relevant in the 90s, when people were using a dial-up service to access
               the Internet.  </p>
           
            <p>Clipper chips are a result off powerful governments wanting to have the capability to read otherwise secure messages through the power of law by mandating these chips. </p>
