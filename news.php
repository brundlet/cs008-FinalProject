            <p>"Surveillance is the business model of the internet."</p>

            <p>This article is an interview conducted by the Harvard Gazette with Bruce Schneier, a fellow of the Berkman Klein Center for Internet and Society. He discusses government and corporate surveillance with the Gazette, which first asked him about the changes in mass surveillance since Edward Snowden’s leaks. According to Schneier, “people should be alarmed,” because there hasn’t been much change in US government surveillance since 2013. He attributes this in part to the lack of current news coverage about cybersecurity and privacy, even pointing out, “it was not an issue in the 2016 election.” </p>
            
            <p>He then goes on to talk about corporate surveillance, saying it is the, “business model of the internet.” The data that corporations collect are used in marketing products to consumers. The business model Schneier is referring to, is websites sell the data they collect on their users to advertisers </p>
