            <h2 class="pages">How To Prevent Identity Theft</h2>
            <p>The key to avoiding the horrors of identity theft is to take important prevention measures. You must:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Be aware of suspicious sites. Many sites are designed to appear legitimate, but really have sinister intent. Always 
                    be cautious when entering sensitive information into a new site.</li>
            </ol>
            <ol>
                <li>Be on the lookout for fake “phishing” emails, calls or texts that claim to come from your bank but are in fact sent 
                    for nefarious purposes.  If something seems off, take a closer look.</li>
            </ol>
            <ol>
                <li>Keep important financial documents in a safe place in your house.  When you no longer need them, never leave such 
                    documents in the trash or recycling where anyone could get to them.  Always shred the documents first.</li>
            </ol>
            <ol>
                <li>Bits of information ranging from your date of birth to your mother’s maiden name are often used as “security 
                    questions” to confirm your identity.  Try to avoid posting such information on social networking and other websites.
                    In the wrong hands, it could be just what someone needs to impersonate you.</li>
            </ol>
            <ol>
                <li>Anyone who gets hold of your credit card can use it however they want.  Be very careful with your purse or wallet 
                    and never leave it unattended.  Never carry things like your Social Security card or written down PIN numbers.  If 
                    your credit card is lost or stolen, cancel that card IMMEDIATELY.</li>
            </ol>
            <ol>
                <li>It is of course important to make sure that your anti-virus and anti-spyware software on your computer is updated 
                    regularly, but do not forget to apply encryption and security applications to your mobile devices, such as smart phones 
                    and tablets, and even flash drives containing sensitive information.  These devices can be lost or stolen just as easily 
                    as your credit card, and need to be protected just as much.</li>
            </ol>
