            <h2 class="pages">What Happens Once My Identity is Stolen?</h2>
            <p>Identity theft is an extremely serious matter. Once hackers obtain your vital information like date of birth, social security number,
                email, password, home address, and zip code, they can instantly assume your identity. Once that happens, they can use your credit 
                card and bank account indiscriminately, siphoning money from your bank account and potentially ruining your credit report.  Here 
                are just a few of the potential adverse effects:  
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>A bad credit report can make it harder to make large purchases, increase your insurance rates, and even make it harder to 
                get a job. </li>
            </ol>
            <ol>
                <li>If your social security number is stolen, they could draw out credits for social security payments later in your life,
                and you could even be sent a tax bill for income you did not earn.</li>
            </ol>
            <ol>
                <li>Criminals have been known to give the police a stolen identity upon being arrested.  This can saddle you with a criminal
                record, which will follow you for the rest of your life.</li>
            </ol>
            <ol>
                <li>If your child's identity is used and gains bad credit, it can go unnoticed for years and cause major problems when 
                applying for college financial aid.</li>
            </ol>
            <ol>
                <li>Some criminals try to avoid creditors by using a stolen identity and then registering themselves as deceased.  If 
                you are regarded as dead by a bank's database, it can be surprisingly hard to convince them otherwise.  </li>
            </ol>
