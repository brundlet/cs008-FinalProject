            <h2 class="pages">What Do I Do Once My Identity is Stolen?</h2>
            <p>There are numerous crucial steps you must take if you suspect that your identity is stolen.
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>The first thing to do if an account is being accessed is to contact the bank or 
                    financial institution and close the account in question or place it on lockdown 
                    to avoid further deductions.
                </li>
            </ol>
            <ol>
                <li>Sign up for a credit monitoring service -- many companies offer one for free to 
                    victims of database leaks.</li>
            </ol>
            <ol>
                <li>Check over older bank statements and credit reports for charges and accounts 
                    that you do not recognize.  The identity theft may have occurred some time 
                    ago and was simply not noticed.</li>
            </ol>
            <ol>
                <li>Identity theft is a very serious crime and the proper authorities should be 
                notified.  Call your local police department and file a report with the Federal 
                Trade Commission.</li>
            </ol>
